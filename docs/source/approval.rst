Submitting Data for Approval
-----------------------------

1. All data that is pending submission for approval will appear on the pending submission tab. Note that you will need to select different questionnaires to see :bolditalic:`pending submissions` for each questionnaire. This is to avoid batching data from different questionnaires in one batch for approval which is not valid.
